# LatinaIL Music: Cultural Integration Analysis

## Project Overview
**LatinaIL Music** is a comprehensive data project designed to explore how the Latina community in Israel integrates into the local culture through music. This project analyzes user habits, demographic data, and song preferences to identify engagement trends with Israeli artists.

This repository demonstrates the full data lifecycle: from **Relational Database Engineering (SQL)** to **Business Intelligence Visualization (Power BI)**.

---

## Tech Stack
* **Database:** SQL Server / MySQL (Relational Schema Design)
* **BI Tool:** Power BI Desktop
* **Visual Enhancements:** Custom JSON Themes & Advance Card Visuals

---

## Phase 1: Database Engineering (SQL)
The core of the project is the `LatinaILlMusic` database, built to ensure high data integrity and complex relational mapping.

### Key Technical Implementations:
* **Robust Schema:** 7 interconnected tables including `Users`, `Artists`, `Songs`, and `ListHabitsUsers`.
* **Advanced Constraints:**
    * `CHECK (BirthDate <= 18 years)`: Implemented age validation for compliance.
    * `CHECK (AlyahYear >= 1948)`: Maintained historical accuracy for immigration data.
    * `CHECK (Email format)`: Used pattern matching to ensure valid contact data.
    * `UNIQUE Constraints`: Prevented duplicate user profiles.
* **Relationship Management:** Utilized junction tables for **Many-to-Many** relationships between Users and their Favorite Artists/Songs, including a preference ranking system.

## Phase 2: Business Intelligence (Power BI)
The insights are visualized in the **Poyecto4.pbix** report, which connects to the SQL backend to provide interactive analytics.

### Dashboard Highlights:
* **Demographic Breakdown:** Analysis of the Latina community by country of origin and Israeli city of residence.
* **Israeli Music Adoption:** A ranking of the most popular local artists among Latin immigrants.
* **Platform Habits:** Visualizing user preference (Spotify vs. YouTube vs. Radio) based on age groups and years since Alyah.
* **Professional UX:** Integrated **Custom Visuals** and a tailored **JSON Theme** for a professional and cohesive aesthetic.

## Repository Structure
* `sql_scripts/`: Contains the full DDL and DML scripts to recreate the database.
* `power_bi/`: The **Poyecto4.pbix** file and report screenshots.
* `data/`: Sample datasets in CSV format.

## How to Run
1.  **Clone** this repository.
2.  **Execute** the scripts located in `sql_scripts/` in your SQL engine.
3.  **Open** `Poyecto4.pbix` in Power BI Desktop to explore the interactive dashboard.
    * *Note: You may need to update the Data Source settings to point to your local SQL instance.*
